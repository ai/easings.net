title: Easing Functions Cheat Sheet
description:
  Make animations more realistic by picking the right easing function.
share:
  Easing functions specify the speed of animation
  to make the movement more natural. Real objects don’t just move
  at a constant speed, and do not start and stop in an instant.
  This page helps you choose the right easing function.

about: __format
  ~~Easing functions~~ specify the rate of change of a parameter
  over time.

  Objects in real life don’t just start and stop instantly, and almost never
  move at a constant speed. When we open a drawer, we first move it quickly,
  and slow it down as it comes out. Drop something on the floor, and it will
  first accelerate downwards, and then bounce back up after hitting the floor.

  This page helps you choose the right easing function.

    disabled:
      Unfortunately, the easing function cannot be set with any PostCSS plugin.
      Can be done with {{@keyframes}}, see above.
