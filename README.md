## Contributing

GitHub has great instructions on how to [set up Git], [fork a project] and
[make pull requests]. If you have a problem with Git, just send your files
directly to <andrey@sitnik.ru>.

[set up Git]:         https://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect
[fork a project]:     https://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/
[make pull requests]: https://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/

### Translate

Just copy the `i18n/en.yml` file to `i18n/CODE.yml` (where `CODE` is
the lowercased [RFC 3066] language code of your target language,
for example `fr-ca` for Canadian French) and translate all messages.

[RFC 3066]: http://www.i18nguy.com/unicode/language-identifiers.html

### Test

1. Install project dependencies:

     ```sh
    yarn install
     ```

2. Thatâ€™s all. Run development server:

     ```sh
    yarn run start
     ```

3. And open [localhost:1234] in browser.
